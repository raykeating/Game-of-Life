wasm-server
====

This is just a simple static server that happens to be able to serve and process WebAssembly files correctly.
NOT intended for production but for development in lieu of the default Python server which still cannot support the `application/wasm` mime type
even after version 3.

For those times you don't want Webpack :p


To install
====

* You first need to install Node JS version 8.9.1 or higher.
